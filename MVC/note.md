Separation of parts of code and knowing what part does what
Models: Objects or data in our code and allow us to work with that data

Controller:Connects Models and views, contains in-between logic eg:routes and middlewares

exports.name -> exporting like this means we need to use . operator to use exact export from that file
moudule.exports -> only one export in that file so no need to use . operator
